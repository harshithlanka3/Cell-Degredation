CellDegredation.py contains helper functions and the final function calendar_aging_capacity_loss(T, soc, time)
  - Temperature will be measured in Â°C but should be converted to K before being put in the function.
  - State of charge is in decimal form.
  - Time in storage must be in hours
  - Additional files can be created to implement real time running data into the function using a csv file
